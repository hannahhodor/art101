			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Learning and practicing basic JavaScript data types and variables. Using JavaScript, we had created variables to display data about a vehicle.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>Originally, the JavaScript page was having trouble actually printing the correct output. I had to make a new JavaScript file for any of the output to appear. We also had difficulty declaring a boolean variable. For example, using "True" versus "true".</p>

	<div>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Shown below is our final script output for the lab. We created a car that should most definitely, without a doubt, and inevitably will exist.</p>
