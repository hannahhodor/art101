		<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
		<p>by Emily Baer and Hannah Hodor</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>Experiment with JavaScript Anonymous Functions and methods that use Callback Functions.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>We figured out that we needed to place defer within the link to the lab8 js file in order for the html to fully load before the js was executed. We also learned that the map() function does not modify the original array. You need to make a new array to store the results of the map() function.</p>
	</div>

<div>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Our results are presented as this website.</p>
