				<h1> Hello World! </h1>
				<p> Tony and I are in McHenry library working on the lab together. I was running late because parking was tricky. I'm looking forward to going home later because I have pineapple fried rice waiting for me. (10/6/22)</p>

				<h1> Hello AGAIN World! </h1>
				<p> I've decided to revisit this lab for the sake of resubmission. I have tidied my Lab 2 document and gave this site a makeover. I present... Lab 2 Jr!</p>
				<p> Pineapple fried rice continues to rule my life. (11/17/22)</p>

				<h2>RIP Lab 2 Snr</h2>
