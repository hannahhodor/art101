	<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
	<h2>By: Philip and Hannah</h2>
	<div class="section">
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>This lab challenged us to pseudocode a computer task. We created a JavaScript code for a computer program to solve a simple puzzle.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>It is uncertain whether or not the instructions we created using JS comments are comprehensible for a program to execute. We were unsure about which JS tags to use from the author block. There was also confusion pertaining to the extent of assignment completion. Extra time was taken to review lab instructions. We referred back to what had been practiced in Lab 3.
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>We organized our lab in this site. Provided here are images of our progress as well as the JavaScript pseudocode.</p>
		<h1>Pseudocode for solving a puzzle</h1>
		<pre><code>
			// How to play a puzzle online.
			  // Pull up an online puzzle.
			    // Find corner pieces.
			      // Match pieces as best you can until the border is made.
			      // Match pieces of similar color.
			        // Start pairing everything together to see if it fits together.
			        // Make bigger pieces.
			      // Keep going until you finish the puzzle.
			  // Enjoy and wonder why Wolverine's power is healthcare or how we've never seen a gorilla at full strength since they don't lift.
