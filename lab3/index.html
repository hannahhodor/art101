	<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
	<h2>By: Aidan and Hannah</h2>
	<div class="section">
		<h2>Subject</h2>
		<p>This lab was about file structure, file transfer, and about making our main webpages.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>We had some confusion with Teletype but were quickly able to collaborate efficiently. We took our time with creating the structures of our respective homepages but remained on the same pace. The lab as a whole was fairly easy.
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Our results from this lab are this website, our art 101 file structure, and our main art101 websites</p>
